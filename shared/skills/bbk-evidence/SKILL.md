# BBK Evidence

<!-- BBK prompt module bbk-prompt-evidence-lineage: expanded from canonical source -->

### Evidence identity, reuse, and invalidation

Bind every observation and receipt to the exact assertion, subject, environment, method, and dependency closure it can establish.

- `EVIDENCE.ASSERTION_FIRST` — State the exact assertion and subject before collecting, reusing, or interpreting evidence.
- `EVIDENCE.FINGERPRINT` — Bind each receipt to candidate or planning subject, operation or method, command, inputs, configuration, environment, toolchain, profile, context and exposure policy, and produced artifacts.
- `EVIDENCE.REUSE` — Reuse a prior PASS only when the complete fingerprint and dependency closure remain unchanged and no invalidation condition has fired.
- `EVIDENCE.OBSERVATION_INFERENCE` — Separate direct observation, source report, inference, evaluation, recommendation, and authority-bearing decision.
- `EVIDENCE.APPEND_ONLY` — Preserve failed attempts, conflicting evidence, exposure history, and superseded state. Later annotations and dispositions link to immutable records rather than rewriting them.
- `EVIDENCE.INVALIDATE` — A material subject, source, assertion, criterion, method, environment, context, independence, or exposure change invalidates only the affected evidence and conclusions; create a successor and preserve unaffected valid reuse.

### Evidence subject and environment identity

Bind observations and quantitative claims to the exact node, environment, source, time, and method so evidence is not transferred between superficially similar systems.

- `EVIDENCE.NODE_BINDING` — Every material environment observation must identify the exact node or subject, node_id when available, hostname or stable system identity, environment and location, observation source, observation time or as-of boundary, method and command or API, scope, authority, and confidence or limitation.
- `EVIDENCE.NO_TRANSFERENCE` — Do not transfer an observation from one machine, account, network, repository, version, jurisdiction, or environment to another merely because they share an operating system or role. Unknown target-node state remains unknown until established or explicitly assumed.
- `EVIDENCE.ESTIMATE_TRUTH` — Bind every quantitative estimate to its source, assumptions, units, environment, uncertainty, and intended use. Label an estimate as measured, documented, calculated, inferred, or illustrative; do not present an unmeasured planning estimate as observed performance.

<!-- BBK prompt module bbk-prompt-evidence-receipts: expanded from canonical source -->

### Evidence representation and receipt protocol

Represent byte, semantic, command, profile, and observation evidence with the exact identity, carrier, trust, completeness, and reuse information needed by assurance roles.

- `EVIDENCE.PLANNING_BINDING` — Bind evidence to the exact planning subject as well as the candidate where applicable: fit revision, outcome references, structure-contract digest, slice IDs, WorkUnit revision, profile digest, assertion, and dependency closure.
- `EVIDENCE.BYTE_IDENTITY` — Use exact SHA-256 bytes for immutable source, manifests, candidates, generated definitions, and artifacts whose byte identity is meaningful.
- `EVIDENCE.SEMANTIC_IDENTITY` — Use canonical structured comparison when semantic equivalence is the claim. Do not treat formatting-only JSON changes as semantic drift, and classify drift as added, removed, byte-changed, semantic-changed, semantic-equivalent, or unavailable rather than merely hash mismatch.
- `EVIDENCE.NONDETERMINISTIC` — Treat compiler output, timestamps, platform metadata, nondeterministic archives, and similar values as semantic or fresh-run receipts unless deterministic byte identity is explicitly required.
- `EVIDENCE.RECEIPT` — An EvidenceReceipt records what actually ran or was observed; exact subject, candidate and assertion; operation or method; command; environment; toolchain and profile; inputs and configuration; outputs and raw carriers; coverage; trust and completeness class; redaction; freshness; exposure; and reuse dependencies. Freeform tests-passed prose or model confidence is not required-gate evidence.
- `EVIDENCE.SEAL` — Seal an evidence object only after collection is complete. Put later annotations outside the sealed object and link them; preserve failed attempts, conflicting evidence, and superseded state.
- `EVIDENCE.NO_SELF_HASH` — Do not hash mutable indexes into themselves or copy one current digest into many hand-maintained authorities. Generate projections from one canonical mapping source.
- `EVIDENCE.PROFILE_BINDING` — For profile-derived evidence, bind exact profile ID and version, source or effective digest, router and focused procedure, capability operation, adapter identity, toolchain context, request digest, and input/output subject. An installed skill name alone establishes neither selection nor qualification.
- `EVIDENCE.COMMAND_STREAMS` — When a configured gate stores only bounded UTF-8 previews in its JSON receipt, preserve authoritative stdout and stderr beside the receipt and bind each by safe project-relative path, byte count, and SHA-256. A reusable PASS remains eligible only while both raw streams match.

## Durable handoff evidence

For an exact deliverable set, prefer `bbk artifact manifest --root <root> --path <path> --output <manifest>` and `bbk artifact verify <manifest> --root <root>` over ad hoc shell or PowerShell hashing. The manifest uses portable relative paths, byte counts, SHA-256, one content digest, deterministic ordering, and excludes BBK examples by default.

### Durable handoff and exact return

Preserve exact or consequential state across role, invocation, host-window, and recovery boundaries without treating a chat channel as the authoritative carrier.

- `HANDOFF.CARRIER` — Store exact, consequential, generated, evidence-heavy, binary, large, or truncation-sensitive material in an authorized durable carrier. A small inline result is acceptable only when no exact state could be lost.
- `HANDOFF.BIND` — Bind every carrier and material referenced artifact by safe project-relative path, exact subject and revision, producer attempt, and declared disposition. Use the BBK package engine to compute byte counts, lowercase SHA-256 values, canonicalization metadata, manifests, and receipts from stored bytes; never hand-author generated identity fields.
- `HANDOFF.VERIFY` — Verify the sealed package and every referenced artifact through the BBK verifier before creation is announced, before consumption or reuse, and after transfer. A locator without matching tool-generated package identity, subject, schema, and reference closure is not an exact handoff.
- `HANDOFF.SEPARATE_STATE` — Keep physical-attempt disposition, role-specific semantic readiness, accountable acceptance, finding closure, completion, and release as separate fields and authorities.
- `HANDOFF.HISTORY` — Preserve partial, failed, blocked, cancelled, stale, superseded, and predecessor state. Never overwrite a published record to make a successor appear originally successful.
- `HANDOFF.CHANNEL_LIMIT` — Use live inter-agent messages only for concise coordination and verified references. Chat, task results, tracker comments, patches, and IRC do not replace the governed final return channel or durable domain object.

## Profile-bound evidence

<!-- BBK prompt module bbk-prompt-profile-qualification: expanded from canonical source -->

### Language, domain, toolchain, and model qualification

Select only applicable installed profiles and focused procedures without allowing them to broaden authority.

- `PROFILE.EXPLICIT` — Use only a profile explicitly supplied or selected from the current installed-profile registry for the exact language, domain, framework, runtime, or toolchain responsibility.
- `PROFILE.FOCUSED` — Load the router and only the focused procedures and gates material to this role and assertion; do not fan out every profile or specialist pack.
- `PROFILE.BIND` — Carry profile identity, version or digest, toolchain assumptions, required gates, qualified operations, unavailable-capability policy, and evidence bindings into child and return contracts.
- `PROFILE.NO_AUTHORITY` — A profile, skill, tool, model route, or host capability adds method and evidence requirements only. It cannot broaden scope, effects, authority, or acceptance.
- `PROFILE.UNAVAILABLE` — When a required profile, toolchain, model, environment, or qualified operation is unavailable, return the exact technical or eligibility blocker instead of improvising qualification.
